# MovieSpace
This is a ToWatchMovie App build with SwiftUI Framework. It uses OMDB API to search movies from imdb with help of search bar by movie title.

After that you can choose any movie and the app sends another request to OMDB API with chosen film ID to get more information about film, such as plot, actors and etc.

Also you can add specific movie to your ToWatch list and delete it from the list once you watched the movie.

Realm is used for saving data of ToWatch list on your device. JSON parsing is done with Codable protocol

Some additional features are in progress...
